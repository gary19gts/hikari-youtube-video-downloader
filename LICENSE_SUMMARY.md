## Understanding AGPL-3.0

### What is AGPL?
The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) is a copyleft license that extends GPL to cover network use.

### Key Points:
1. **Network Copyleft**: If users interact with your software over a network, you must provide source code
2. **Strong Copyleft**: All derivative works must also be AGPL-3.0
3. **Freedom to Use**: Anyone can use, modify, and distribute
4. **Transparency**: Source code must be available

### When AGPL Applies:
- ‚úÖ You modify Hikari and distribute it
- ‚úÖ You build a web service using Hikari
- ‚úÖ You create a SaaS product with Hikari
- ‚úÖ Users interact with Hikari over a network

### When AGPL Doesn't Apply:
- ‚ùå Personal use only (no distribution)
- ‚ùå Internal company use (no external users)
- ‚ùå Learning and experimentation
